# Classifiying Mushroom: finding out the best predictive machine learning model
Mushroom classification dataset has been fetched from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification). The dataset classifies mushrooms into two categories: poinsonous (p) and edible (e). Against each each record of mushroom 22 variables or attributes have been recorded. The aim of this data exploration is to narrow down the variables to identify the most important ones to be used for predicting mushroom type and build appropriate machine learning model to come up with highest accuracy.
